It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to add, edit, and save tasks. The scheduler is tailored specifically for work-related tasks, allowing users to prioritize their workload and stay on top of deadlines.

To install my Work Day scheduler app from my GitHub repository, you need to follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: you can do this by using the git clone command followed by the URL of the repository.
2. Navigate to the Repository Directory: use the cd command to navigate into the directory of the cloned repository
3. Run the Scheduler: once you've cloned the repository and configured the project (if necessary), you should be able to run the Workday scheduler.
4. Test: after installation, it's a good practice to test the scheduler to ensure it's working as expected. Create some test schedules or tasks to verify its functionality.
